This is my first genetic algorithm (GA). In this respository, GA is used to a parameter optimization problem.

The code is developed in Python.

Watch the "Michalewicz Genetic Algorithms + Data Structures = Evolution Programs 3rd Edition" Part 1, Chapter 2 in order to know more about the problem resolved with this code.

It will use 1000 generation in order to maximize the problem.

For each generation it will show the fitness function value in order to watch the results clearly.
